Iris Classification Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements an **Iris flower classification model** using **TensorFlow**, **scikit-learn**, **NumPy**, and **pandas**. The model classifies flowers into three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

The dataset used is the famous **Iris dataset**, which contains **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width** as features.

## Key Features
- Supervised Learning Approach - Uses labeled data for training.
- TensorFlow Model             - Utilizes neural networks for classification.
- scikit-learn Integration     - Data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- NumPy & Pandas               - Efficient handling of numerical computations and data manipulation.
- High Accuracy                - Achieves optimal classification performance with well-tuned hyperparameters.

## Technology Stack
- Programming Language         - Python
- Libraries                    - TensorFlow, scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Dataset                      - Iris dataset 

## How It Works
1. Load the Iris               - dataset using scikit-learn.
2. Preprocess the data         - by normalizing features and splitting into training/testing sets.
3. Train a classification model- using TensorFlow (e.g., Neural Networks) or scikit-learn (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, etc.).
4. Evaluate the model          - using accuracy and confusion matrix.
5. Make predictions            - on new samples and visualize the results.
